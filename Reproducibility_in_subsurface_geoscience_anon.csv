For example, seismic sections do not match measured values in tables. ",No,,Yes,Often,Rarely,Often,Sometimes,Often,Often,Sometimes,Often,"Historical use:
When a paper is referred to over a number of decades and becomes almost colloquial. A paper's reproducibility may only have been tested once (if at all!) and yet may be treated as truth. Innovative papers from decades ago that continue to be name-dropped should still be held to same standards of reproducibility as new papers where possible. We as a community can't give these seminal papers a 'free ride'. 

Poor quality online material:
Some articles are reproduced from scans, especially if older or produced in print originally. The figures are often distorted or the colours affected. This affects whether the results can be reproduced. This may not be a pervasive problem but could have an affect. This ties into the following point. 

Reliance on conference abstracts references: 
Conference abstracts are excellent for innovation. However, some individuals use this as a loop-hole. An individual may refer to a conference abstract which may not be available or only partially available e.g. the conference abstract but not the associated poster/slides.  I believe any research should be treated with care (regardless of its source) and the reader should have access to the data required to make an informed decision. Conference abstracts, at least in my experience, fall into this category a lot more than other research outputs.

Method:
If you use the same mathematical function 100 times you *could* get the same result BUT the method may not be valid/appropriate. The link between validity and reproducibility is difficult. ",Often,Sometimes,Sometimes,Often,Sometimes,Sometimes,Often,Sometimes,Rarely,"It is a hard one to get right, but I think data points are often cherry-picked. Individuals conducting research may include only data that backs up their working theory. Note that this is subtly different (at least in mentality) from choosing the best examples - the research output needs to be understandable by the readers! 

Poorly-executed reproducibility studies! ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Maybe,"Providing access to research output can introduce bias. For example, seismic horizons might be interpreted very similarly if you have 'toggle' access to another researcher's outputs. It is difficult to not be influenced by others' work. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,"Wasn't quite sure where to write this so forgive me: I like your definition of reproducibility although one thing I wasn't clear on: is reproducibility the ability to reproduce your results using *the same methods* or can you also use *new methods*. If the former, you may get the same results but the method still needs to be critiqued. If the latter, the assurance in the outcome increases which I would assume is the overall goal i.e. yes vs. no vs. maybe. Other than that, great idea to survey people on this topic! "

(They may not be for commercial reasons, say, but my data is generally open access after some time.)  The key is to document any steps in clear documentation or code where they were not made explicit in publications.  This is best done by including a single script which does the entire analysis on the data at hand and makes the figures and tables.  This is often not possible with large datasets, in which case a pseudo-script can be written where the large-data or -compute parts are labelled as such and pointers are left to the scripts and data elsewhere (e.g., on HPC machines).

It occurred to me during the construction of an IODP proposal or within an industry consultancy where blind test were performed against certain logically proposed prediction grounded on an interpretation, forcing me to rethink the all intepretation process. The reason are different: because different ideas came back to me or different input from colleagues ,reviewers from industry and academia that did cross my work. I think it should be the correct attitude: to test assumptions, to make clear the logical workflow that driven us to produce a certain interpretation (image processed or and interpretation of processed data), make sure it is clearly exposed and can be tested, and then to question.The assumption are often multiple:.they can derive from assuming the seismic or well data as good data although they can derive from assuming certain interpretation instead of other. The point is that those assumptions and the derived hypothesis should be questioned as far as the dataset allow us to do that. And often the dataset cannot be released in a format that allow us the full access to the community . On the other side we need to accept the scientific approach is constrained to limits and uncertainty and biases which are intrisic to every scientific dataset. Beyond certain resolution or certain details they can t be tested..but this need to be stated and acknowledged upfront in any paper. I don t see a real issue with that : this is what make science more prone to evolve: fine tuning methodology,  datasets, testing hypothesis and questioning assumption. Different opinions grounded on a scientific  method,  are the seed of the science,  as far as i can get somehow access to the dataset.",Yes,"Often when i do start my research or interpretation, I do revise literature and that nmay imply revising proposed interpretation on the given dataset or literally reinterpreting published dataset . That is possible when the seismic data, well log or maps are released in a clear and transparent manner,, when the source of data and processing techniques used are specified. Which is one of the main issues often when reading paper or publications. Confidentiality partly kill our confidence on those dato ability to check with the correct software. Although in any science, reviewing process can't get through the all process: it is like asking to particle physics to rerun collision experiment or to a reviewer to re run  reprocessing of data. There is a certain level of trust that is required. Soon or later other people will re acquire or reprocess in the same area or same data and therefore results will be fully tested in a way or in another. The point is that data published need to be released in some usable or good quality format and methodology , techniques and the interpretation workflow process need to be explained, and therefore the logical steps should be reproducible. i am aware this is very often still not possibleâ€¦..",No,,Yes,Often,Sometimes,Often,Rarely,Rarely,Sometimes,Often,Often,The problem to me is the difficulty to unravel details about interpretation or processing tool that derived from industry software. we know most of the image processing or processing algorithm used out of the industry software do work and can be in part tested (apply the tool to a well know dataset which we know the results of) but the details of the code or algorithm that have been modified to produce the new tool cannot be fully accessed. This is a pain and therefore has obliged me to reduce the use of attributes unless i could touch or test the  entire algorithm.,Sometimes,Sometimes,Sometimes,Sometimes,Sometimes,Sometimes,Often,Rarely,Rarely,I believe there are limits which are intrisic to the structure of certain journal or paper: you don t have enough space  to fully explain the methodology or discuss the limits in the methodology. therefore or you split the discussion across  different publication or you are forced to omit the details and create supplementary material which should be reviewed as well.,Yes,Yes,Yes,Maybe,Maybe,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,"I believe that for several topics the statistical analysis may not necessarily improve the approach, or scientific validity or explanation. Certain structure or depositional features observed are unique ..therefore require a solid and logical explanation grounded on different hypothesis on the process which may have triggered their development but cannot be tested statistically. As they are unique within their geological or regional context . Maybe certain structural or depositional features which contribute to the process characterization may be statistically analyzed but the statistical approach may often be a simple formal approach which does not constitute the core of the proof of understanding of the  process. Finally:  Forcing the authors to upload the dataset in a re-usable shape to be tested by the scientific community. If the data results and interpretation are publishable then  the industry dataset should be released publicly. But it is not matter of the sole industry: research center which acquire seismic or well often do not release the data the data to the scientific community after their publication  should be challenged .

A lot is confidential data. For some areas  the full data seismic data sets available. New Zealand, Australia, parts of Europe yes. Working in companies one often gets old data sets, make an interpretation, then get new seismic data, and re-interpret the data or a colleague does, then the data gets reprocessed, and another interpretation is done, then some wells are drilled, and they are incorporated into the interpretation. So yes there is a lot of iteration and updating. Academically I have had the opportunity to re-interpret data I have published (I published the Amoco Kenya data from the late 1980's in an AAPG book in 1999), then consulted for Tullow in 2013, and they had reprocessed the old data (as well as acquiring new data) - it was very interesting to see how my old results compared with the data 20+ years on. I have a PhD student working on 3D data that I first interpreted in PTTEP 10 years ago. So there are different ways in which my results get re-appraised later. ",Yes,"Yes, most notably LaKe Tanganyika, where Bruce Rosendahl's group interpreted project Probe seismic data (regarding transfer zones one way). I had access to their data (company subscription to the project) disagreed with their published interpretation and published an alternative interpretation. Then subsequently Jean-Jacques Tiercelin acquired some new infill seismic data on the lake, and published an updated version - fortunately it supported my version. ",Yes,"The Late Tanganyika example.

Due to the effort and expense, I can see why research institutions might also want maintain control over distribution of their data.   I do think it is reasonable to expect that the data is made available, and I don't like the idea of journals trying to make data availability a condition of publishing.

If you publish from open source data like the New Zealand Government it is easy to go in and check the data in the pubication against the  published data. The opposite case is where many people may have worked for months or years on confidential data in an oil company, internally the data has be extensively cross-checked and interpreted, but when it comes to publication you can only publish a fragment of the data, and have to keep locations confidential etc. The data is still valuable, and it is the only way it will see the light of day, and benefit the understanding of the geological community. But it won't be reproducible. I think allowances have to be made for this in Earth Sciences. This works at the moment, but I only see societies getting in the way if you allow a bureaucracy more power, and 'increased standards'.Most often it is the sheer scale of the subsurface data. You are not going to place a 3D seismic data cube in an archive for people to access (confidentiality, cost of the data, download time, archive space). So how can you expect open access reproducibility. If it is company data you are not going to invite an outsider into the office for a few months to interpret the data. So while I understand  the reasons for pushing for reproducibility, I think the degree to which it can be done across Earth Science publications is highly variable, and there is a danger Industry data could get excluded if standards are too rigidly enforced.

I feel that there should be an imposed time limit before which such research is made available to the public. Typically this work is reproducible as staff at the sponsor companies will be following the projects and applying the results. Having seen some really cool science hidden away in JIPs, it would be great to know that there was perhaps a 10 year limit on confidentiality. This could also help address some issues regarding what is and isn't academic work.  The model could be that if ultimately the work will be shared openly with the public, perhaps after a time-limit, then it is research, if not, it is consultancy..."

(1) Lack of publicly available raw data. Many 2D and 3D seismic volumes exist but are impossible to access for academic researchers, unless they directly have a collaborative agreement. It would be great if petroleum and seismic acquisition companies were more open to sharing data with academic researchers.
(2) Lack of published processed data. Almost all articles published with seismic data just point to a repository where there is raw data. However, others may not have the same software and access to algorithms to reproduce the processed images. It should be mandatory to upload SEGY-Y files of the images used in any published journal article. This would give researchers a chance to build on the interpretation of others without needed processing skills and software (not to mention that processing a seismic volume can take several years, and Masters/PhD students won't have time for that). 
(3) Lack of published interpretations. Would be nice to have published seismic horizons and faults that are published in journals. This one is a little more tricky. In my last manuscript, I did all of the interpretations in Adobe Illustrator, so I would be happy to upload .ai files with the interpretations, but I wouldn't be able to provide x,y,z grids, for example.
